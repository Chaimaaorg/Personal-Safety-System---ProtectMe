# ProtectMe - Personal Safety App

## Overview
**ProtectMe** is a personal safety and medical emergency application designed to ensure the safety and well-being of users. The app integrates IoT (Internet of Things) technology with a mobile application to provide real-time location tracking, emergency alerts, and heart rate monitoring. It is developed for both **Android** and **iOS** platforms using **Flutter** and **Dart**, with backend services powered by **Firebase**.

The app allows users to:
- Send emergency alerts to predefined contacts with their real-time location.
- Monitor heart rate using IoT sensors.
- Locate nearby emergency services such as hospitals, police stations, pharmacies, and medical clinics.
- Provide detailed directions and transportation options to reach these services.

## Features
### For the Primary User:
1. **Emergency Alert**: Send instant alerts to predefined contacts with the user's real-time location.
2. **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the user's heart rate using IoT sensors.
3. **Nearby Services**: Locate nearby hospitals, police stations, pharmacies, and medical clinics.
4. **Real-Time Location Tracking**: Share the user's real-time location with emergency contacts.
5. **Contact Management**: Add, edit, or remove emergency contacts.
6. **Profile Management**: Update personal information and view health metrics (e.g., heart rate, steps).

### For Emergency Contacts:
1. **Real-Time Location Tracking**: View the primary user's real-time location on a map.
2. **Emergency Notifications**: Receive instant alerts when the primary user triggers an emergency.
3. **Contact Management**: View and manage the list of users who have added them as emergency contacts.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- **Flutter**: For cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for Flutter.

### Backend:
- **Firebase**: For user authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage.
- **Firestore**: NoSQL database for real-time data synchronization.
- **Foursquare API**: For locating nearby emergency services (hospitals, police stations, etc.).
- **Google Maps API**: For real-time location tracking and directions.

### IoT Components:
- **Arduino UNO**: For heart rate monitoring and data collection.
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: For GPS tracking and emergency alert triggering.
- **GPS Module**: For real-time location tracking.
- **Heart Rate Sensor**: For continuous heart rate monitoring.
- **LCD Display**: For displaying heart rate data.

### Programming Languages:
- **Java**: For Android app development.
- **Python**: For IoT device programming (GPS and button press).
- **C++**: For Arduino programming (heart rate sensor).

## Architecture
The app follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture:
1. **Model**: Handles data and business logic (e.g., user data, heart rate, location).
2. **View**: Manages the user interface (UI) and displays data to the user.
3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing user interactions and updating the UI.

### Physical Architecture:
- **IoT Devices**: Arduino and Raspberry Pi for heart rate monitoring and GPS tracking.
- **Mobile App**: Flutter-based app for user interaction and data visualization.
- **Backend**: Firebase for real-time data storage and synchronization.
